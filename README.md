e-Folio
=====

e-olio is simple open source ePortfolio management platform (EMP) that is robust, yet easy to use and maintain.  The EMP will accept and store digital artifacts, including web addresses.  It will also contain an online editor for "composing" web pages using the stored artifacts as embedded or linked content.  The collection of web pages can then be shared with others as an "ePortfolio" that can itself be stored as an artifact in the EMS.  We believe a simple framework for building and sharing ePortfolios can be designed to operate on the desktop and/or any cloud.

Uses of the EMP would be primarily for education.  The system would respond well to many students need to gather, sort, and organize the growing number of digital artifacts they create in different courses, different programs, and extracurricular activities over the years they are in school.  The editor adds potential for creative design and composition, and the communication tools expand the audiences a student can have (peers, instructors, administrators, potential employers) even as she or he retains original ownership of the work. Plus, when they leave -- whether they are switching institutions, or after they complete their education -- students can take their EMP and their work with them. A successful EMP can be a student's life-long companion.
