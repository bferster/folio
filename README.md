Folio
=====
Mandala Folio is a tool to select and organize elements created in the Mandala Digital Ecology and create scholarly arguments and attractive presentations to share with others. Any web-addressable element can be included into the presentation, directly embedded or as a clickable link, including:

Images, simulations, and 3D models
Kaltura videos
Mandala Audio/Video collections
Mandala Text documents
Mandala Source bibliographical entries
PDF and PowerPoint files
Qmedia interactive media shows
SHIVA visualizations
VisualEyes geo-timelines and interactive maps
Websites
WordPress pages/sites

There are two parts to Mandala Folio: A simple authoring tool for collecting, organizing, and annotating the presentations, and a collection of display modules that render the result of that authoring on multiple display platforms, independently of how they will be displayed.

Each element can be sized and positioned independently and have completely customizable text and graphics supporting it. There are a number of ways to visually structure Folio presentations regardless of how they are published. The following views are supported:

PowerPoint view - Resembles a traditional Powerpoint slide-based presentation, with each element on its own page, and viewers can navigate between pages via mouse click, key hit, or graphical navigation menu.


Canvas view - Similar to the way Prezi works. All elements are rendered on a large virtual canvas that can be scrolled and zoomed by the user and/or author-guided. The old SHIVA Poster tool is an idea of how this could work (see: www.viseyes.org/shiva/poster.htm).


Single page view - The single vertical-scrolling web design is a very popular technique for designing websites these days and Folio would present the element one after the other vertically, with some navigational finding aids.


Booklet view - A version of the PowerPoint view with an embedded table of contents and book-like navigational aids.

An author can quickly publish their presentation to multiple platforms: as a standalone website, a page within a WordPress site, as an button embedded within a rich text editor, as a narrated screencast movie, and even as a simple PDF document. 

WordPress plug-in - A custom WordPress plugin that can be installed into any WordPress site that renders the presentation elements in any of the views, on-the-fly.


Stand-alone website - A link to a simple webapp that will display the presentation in any of the views and rendered on-the-fly.

Drupal module - A custom Drupal module that can be installed into any Drupal site that renders the presentation elements in any of the views, on-the-fly.


Rich Text editor button - A custom CKE plugin that can be installed into any webpage that provides a button that connects to the Folio editor and embeds a link to the completed presentation into the HTML itself.

PDF document - A page-by-page print out of each item as it currently exists. For website items, each page is rendered and allows the viewer to look at the site even if the link has been taken down. For items such as 3D models, video, and images, the author can create pages of selected videos or frames that best statically represent the original, more dynamic item.


Narrated screencast - More dynamic items such as presentations, 3D sites, architectural plan, interactive visualizations, websites, and video can benefit from creating screen recordings of the author walking the viewer through the item.


Folio is HTML5-based with a client-centric, distributed resource approach that supports massive use with the need for massive scaling of server resources It supports the SHANTI K-maps for advances organization and navigation.
